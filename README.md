# Cryptocurrencies

Our client Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank is interewsted in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for thier customers. They have asked for me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Overview

We now understand what unsupervised learning is used for compared to supervised learning. we know how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. I will put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for my clients who is preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market

## Deliverable 1

Using your knowledge of Pandas, you’ll preprocess the dataset in order to perform PCA in Deliverable 2.

## Deliverable 2

Using your knowledge of how to apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, you’ll reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.

## Deliverable 3

Using your knowledge of the K-means algorithm, you’ll create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then, you’ll run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data.

## Deliverable 4

Using your knowledge of creating scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot, you’ll visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components you created in Deliverable 2, then you’ll create a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
